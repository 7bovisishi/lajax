However, some players may not want to install or use the Social Club and Rockstar Launcher software that are required to play the game online. These software may cause compatibility issues, performance problems, or privacy concerns for some users. Fortunately, there is a way to play Max Payne 3 without them, by using a patch that downgrades the game to an older version that does not require them.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install the patch, and how to run the game offline without any extra software. Note that this method will disable the online multiplayer mode of the game, so you will only be able to play the single-player campaign.
 
## Step 1: Download the patch
 
The patch for Max Payne 3 is available from this link: [https://sharemods.com/24el603ngu91/MaxPayne3\_Remove\_Social\_Club\_v2.7z.html](https://sharemods.com/24el603ngu91/MaxPayne3_Remove_Social_Club_v2.7z.html). This patch will downgrade your game to version 1.0.0.55, which is the last version before the Rockstar Launcher update. The patch is compatible with both Windows and Linux systems.
 
After downloading the patch, extract the files using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a new folder called MaxPayne3\_Remove\_Social\_Club\_v2 in the location where you extracted the files. Copy everything inside this folder.
 
## Step 2: Install the patch
 
Now you need to browse to your Max Payne 3 install directory. A easy way to find it is right click Max Payne 3 in your Steam library and then click Manage > Browse local files. Now double-click the Max Payne 3 folder.
 
Paste the files you copied from the patch folder into the Max Payne 3 folder, and replace everything when prompted to. Then right click install.bat and run it as administrator. This will apply the patch to your game files.
 
## Step 3: Play the game
 
If everything went right, you should now be able to launch Max Payne 3 without installing Social Club and Rockstar Launcher. You can do this by running PlayMaxPayne3.exe from your game folder, or by launching it from Steam as usual.
 
You will see a message saying that you are playing offline mode, and that you need to sign in to Social Club to access online features. You can ignore this message and click OK. You will then be able to start a new game or load a saved game from the main menu.
